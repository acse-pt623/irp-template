    abstract = {Copper is one of the valuable natural resources, and it was widely used in many different industries. The complicated fluctuations of copper prices can significantly affect other industries. Therefore, this study aims to develop and propose several forecast models for forecasting monthly copper prices in the future based on various algorithms in machine learning, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting tree (GBT), and random forest (RF). The monthly copper price dataset from January 1990 to December 2019 was collected for this aim based on other metals and natural gas prices. In addition, the influence of currency exchange rates of the countries that have the largest copper production around the world was also taken into account and used as input variables for forecasting copper price. The different set of predictors (t, t-1, t-2, t-3, t-4. t-5) were considered to forecast monthly copper prices based on the mentioned machine learning techniques. The results revealed that the currency exchange rates of the countries that have the most abundant copper production around the world have a significant effect on the volatility of monthly copper prices in the world, and they should be used to forecast monthly copper prices in the future. A comprehensive comparison of various machine learning techniques shows that MLP neural network (with deep learning techniques) is the best method for forecasting monthly copper price with an MAE of 228.617 and RMSE of 287.539. Whereas, the other models, such as SVM, RF, KNN, and GBT, provided higher errors with an MAE in the range of 308.691–453.147, RMSE in the range of 393.599–552.208. In this sense, MLP neural network can be used as a reliable tool to forecast copper prices in the future.}

    abstract = {The copper prices in international trade markets are volatile. An accurate copper price prediction may guide commodity trading and firm profits in the copper industry. In this paper, a hybrid predictive technique combining complex network and traditional artificial neural network (ANN) techniques is developed for copper price forecasting. This technique first transforms the original price time series to a price volatility network (PVN) and extracts the volatility characteristics from the topological structure of the PVN. After the original data are reconstructed, three widely used ANN techniques, the BPNN, RBFNN, and ELM, are applied to forecast the future copper price. To examine the forecasting performance of the proposed PVN-ANN techniques, the published data of copper spot prices from the New York Commodity Exchange (COMEX) are used. The empirical results show that the proposed hybrid PVN-ANN techniques can obtain a favorable prediction effect in both level and directional predictions compared to those of the traditional ANN techniques. This result clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid predictive techniques in revealing the underlying nonlinear patterns of international copper prices.}

Through this approach, we investigated 9,211 financial news articles and 10,259,042 stock quotes covering the S&P 500 stocks during a five week period. We applied our analysis to estimate a discrete stock price twenty minutes after a news article was released. Using a support vector machine (SVM) derivative specially tailored for discrete numeric prediction and models containing different stock-specific variables, we show that the model containing both article terms and stock price at the time of article release had the best performance in closeness to the actual future stock price (MSE 0.04261), the same direction of price movement as the future price (57.1\% directional accuracy) and the highest return using a simulated trading engine (2.06\% return). We further investigated the different textual representations and found that a Proper Noun scheme performs better than the de facto standard of Bag of Words in all three metrics.},

In this paper, the relationship between oil prices and the price of gold and silver was analysed by BDS test, non-linear ARDL approach and two non-linear Granger causality methods for 1973:1 – 2012:11 period in Turkey. This study complements previous empirical papers. However, it differs from the existing literature with simultaneous use of nonlinear ARDL and two non-linear causality model: Hiemstra and Jones (1994) non-linear causality and augmented granger causality developed by this paper. The main findings of this paper are: (a) the gold price level showed positive asymmetric response to changes in the oil price in the short-- and long-run. The gold price probably possesses some market power and it is a means of store of value. Because of the exception of gold, there is a substantial sluggishness in the adaption to changes in demand. In the long run the exception of gold lags and adjustment costs should play a smaller part; b) there is a unique long-term relationship between oil prices and the prices of gold, silver and cooper; and (c) there is a unidirectional Granger causality between oil price and precious metal price.}

    abstract = {An accurate forecasting model for the price volatility of minerals plays a vital role in future investments and decisions for mining projects and related companies. In this paper, a hybrid model is proposed to provide an accurate model for forecasting the volatility of copper prices. The proposed model combines the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and genetic algorithm (GA). Genetic algorithms are used for estimating the ANFIS model parameters. The results of the proposed model are compared to other models, including ANFIS, support vector machine (SVM), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. The empirical results confirm the superiority of the hybrid GA--ANFIS model over other models. The proposed model also improves the forecasting accuracy obtained from the ANFIS, SVM, GARCH, and ARIMA models by a 62.92{\%}, 36.38{\%}, 91.72{\%}, and 42.19{\%} decrease in mean square error, respectively.},

Using a total of 18 predictor variables that include traditional fundamental indicators such as excess demand, inventories and the convenience yield, as well as indicators related to global risk appetite, momentum, the term spread, and various other financial series, we show that there exists a considerable predictive component in copper returns. Covering an out-of-sample period from May 2002 to June 2014 and employing standard statistical evaluation criteria we show that the out-of-sample R2 (relative to a random walk benchmark) can be as high as 18.5 percent for the DMA framework. Time series plots of the cumulative mean squared forecast errors and time varying coefficients show further that firstly, a large part of the improvement in the forecasts is realised during the peak of the financial crisis period at the end of 2008, and secondly that the importance of the most relevant predictor variables has changed substantially over the out-of-sample period. The coefficients of the SP500, the VIX, the yield spread, the TED spread, industrial production and the convenience yield predictors are most heavily affected, with the TED spread and yield spread coefficients even changing signs over this period. Our predictability results remain valid for forecast horizons up to 6 months ahead, but are weaker and smaller than at the one month horizon.}

    abstract = {Sentiment Analysis (SA) is an ongoing field of research in text mining field. SA is the computational treatment of opinions, sentiments and subjectivity of text. This survey paper tackles a comprehensive overview of the last update in this field. Many recently proposed algorithms' enhancements and various SA applications are investigated and presented briefly in this survey. These articles are categorized according to their contributions in the various SA techniques. The related fields to SA (transfer learning, emotion detection, and building resources) that attracted researchers recently are discussed. The main target of this survey is to give nearly full image of SA techniques and the related fields with brief details. The main contributions of this paper include the sophisticated categorizations of a large number of recent articles and the illustration of the recent trend of research in the sentiment analysis and its related areas.}
